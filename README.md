# number-guess-game

This repo contains my first introduction to JavaScript. Inside you will find a number guessing game in which the computer will randomly generate a number that the user must guess. Are you psychic? Let's find out!

## Organization Overview  

The application is organized using individual HTML, CSS and Javascript files. The javascipt captures the users response as well as generates the random number to be guessed, then compares this response and logs the users' response to the screen. The number generated will also change upon every key press. If the 'keystroke' guessed by the user is not a number, the term 'NaN' will appear on the screen (NaN stands for 'not a number')


## Getting Started

To get started simply click the deployment link and begin guessing. 3 correct guesses wins the game, however 5 incorrect guesses loses the game. If the user wins/loses, the user will be prompted to restart the game. Good Luck!
